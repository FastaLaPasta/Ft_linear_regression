# ft_linear_regression: Linear Regression for Car Price Prediction

This project, part of the 42 school curriculum, implements a linear regression model to predict car prices based on mileage and other factors.

## Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Develop a linear regression model that accurately predicts car prices using provided data.

- **Key Features:**  
  - Data cleaning and normalization  
  - Implementation of linear regression  
  - Model evaluation and precision measurement  
  - Visualization of regression outputs


## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
    cd yourrepo/ft_linear_regression
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Python 3 installed and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Data:**
    The dataset is provided in `data.csv`.

## Usage

- **Training the Model:**  
  Run `train.py` to train the linear regression model.

- **Prediction & Evaluation:**  
  Use `ft_linear_regression.py` and `precision.py` to generate predictions and evaluate the model's performance.

- **Visualization:**  
  Refer to `linear_regression.png` for an example output of the regression analysis.

## Challenges & Learnings

- Handling and cleaning real-world data  
- Implementing regression algorithms both from scratch and with libraries  
- Evaluating model performance and accuracy
